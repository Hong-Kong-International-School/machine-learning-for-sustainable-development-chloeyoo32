## Machine Learning Project
Plant Disease Detection
This project is aimed at developing a powerful and user-friendly tool to detect plant diseases using deep learning techniques. By automating disease identification and providing accurate diagnoses, we strive to help farmers and gardeners make informed decisions in managing their crops. This project contributes to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2: Zero Hunger, by promoting sustainable agriculture practices and ensuring food security for all.

# Overview
Our plant disease detection system utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on a comprehensive dataset of plant images with various diseases. Users can upload images of their plants, and the system will analyze these images to identify the presence of any diseases. Our goal is to provide a reliable, accurate, and easy-to-use tool to support farmers and gardeners in maintaining the health of their crops and ultimately increasing yield.

# Features
